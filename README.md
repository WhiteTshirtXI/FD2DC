This program solved 2D transient Navier-Stokes Equations using the SIMPLE algorithm and Fictitious Domain / Immersed Boundary method.  

See the following papers for more details:

A new implicit fictitious domain method for the simulation of flow in complex geometries with heat transfer
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, Journal of Computational Physics 237, 21-45.

A correlation for the calculation of the local Nusselt number around circular cylinders in the range 10 ⩽ Re ⩽ 250 and 0.1 ⩽ Pr ⩽ 40
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 59, 219-229.

On the application of immersed boundary, fictitious domain and body-conformal mesh methods to many particle multiphase flows
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, International Journal of Multiphase Flow 40, 38-55.

A Makefile is provided to build the program. The program has been tested on several systems however, only distributed in a hope to be useful for learning fixed mesh approaches in CFD.

This code is not being developed actively and you may find some redundant features. If you are planning to use the Software or had any problems feel free to contact me through
